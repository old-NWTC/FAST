/* Error handling
 * --------------
 *
 * You should use the following technique to report errors encountered within
 * an S-function:
 *
 *       ssSetErrorStatus(S,"Error encountered due to ...");
 *       return;
 *
 * Note that the 2nd argument to ssSetErrorStatus must be persistent memory.
 * It cannot be a local variable. For example the following will cause
 * unpredictable errors:
 *
 *      mdlOutputs()
 *      {
 *         char msg[256];    {ILLEGAL: to fix use "static char msg[256];"}
 *         sprintf(msg,"Error due to %s", string);

 *         return;
